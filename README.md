Project Description

This project is intended to help a user find a similar song both in the Hot 100 List or another plalist, by clustering the audio feautures.

The playlist next to the top 100 includes 10000 songs

The main part includes also the clustering as it is important to find the optimal cluster for the song feautures.

Organization
I structured the different functions by focusing on the different possibilities if the song is in the top 100 list.
